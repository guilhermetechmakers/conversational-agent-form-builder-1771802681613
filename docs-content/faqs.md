# FAQs

## General

### What is Agent Builder?

Agent Builder lets you create conversational forms—AI-powered agents that collect structured data through natural dialogue. Share a link, and visitors chat with your agent instead of filling out a form.

### What's the difference from a form?

Traditional forms have fixed steps and high drop-off. Conversational agents adapt to user responses, handle ambiguity, and feel more natural. Completion rates are typically 2–3x higher.

### Do I need to code?

No. The Agent Builder is a visual builder. For advanced integrations, we provide an API and webhooks.

### How do sessions work?

A session is one conversation with an agent. It starts when a user opens your link and ends when they complete or abandon the conversation.
