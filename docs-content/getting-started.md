# Getting Started

Welcome to the Conversational Agent Form Builder. This guide will help you create your first agent in minutes.

## Prerequisites

- An account (sign up at [Agent Builder](https://app.example.com/signup))
- A basic understanding of the data you want to collect

## Step 1: Create an Agent

1. Log in to your [Dashboard](/dashboard)
2. Click **Create Agent**
3. Give your agent a name and optional description

## Step 2: Define Fields

Add fields that you want to collect from users. Supported types include:

- **Text** – Short or long form responses
- **Email** – Validated email addresses
- **Phone** – Phone numbers with format validation
- **Select** – Single or multi-select options
- **Number** – Numeric values with min/max
- **Date** – Date picker

Each field can be marked as required or optional.

## Step 3: Configure Persona

Set the agent's personality and greeting message. This shapes how the conversation feels to users.

## Step 4: Get Your Link

Once published, you'll receive a unique public URL. Share it anywhere—embed in emails, add to your website, or use in ads.
